## 1. Floss

### What to Look For with Floss

- **Waxed floss** for easier glide and reduced shredding
- **Dental tape** for tight teeth (flat, wide, gentle)
- **Textured or woven floss** for deep plaque removal
- **Floss picks** for convenience (not as thorough)
- **Water flossers** for sensitive gums or dexterity issues

### What to Avoid with Floss

- Thin, unwaxed floss that shreds
- Snapping floss into gums
- Using picks as a substitute for regular flossing (unless necessary)

### Floss Examples

- *Oral-B Glide Comfort Plus* (smooth, tape style)
- *Cocofloss* (textured, deep cleaning)
- *DrTung’s Smart Floss* (stretchy, gentle)
- *TePe Interdental Brushes* (for larger gaps)

## 2. Toothbrushes

### Manual Brushes

- **Ultra-soft bristles** (e.g., Curaprox 5460)
- **Small head** for maneuverability
- **Gentle circular motion** recommended

### Electric Brushes

- **Oscillating (Oral-B)** or **Sonic (Philips Sonicare)**
- Built-in **2-minute timer**
- **Pressure sensor** to prevent gum damage
- Rechargeable battery (better than disposable)

### What to Avoid with Toothbrushes

- Medium or hard bristles
- Brushes without quality control or bristle integrity
- No-name electrics with only vibration (not oscillation)

## 3. Toothpastes

### Key Options

- **Fluoride toothpastes**: Protect against cavities, remineralize enamel
  - *Colgate Total SF*, *Sensodyne Pronamel*
- **Non-fluoride alternatives**: Best paired with excellent hygiene
  - Look for **nano-hydroxyapatite**, **xylitol**, **calcium phosphate**
  - *Davids Natural*, *Boka*, *Risewell*
- **Probiotic or herbal toothpastes**: Supportive, not substitutes
  - Guava, aloe, tea tree, coconut oil are common ingredients

### What to Avoid with Toothpastes

- Pastes with harsh foaming agents (e.g., SLS) if sensitive

## 4. Tongue Scrapers

### Recommended Materials

- **Stainless steel** – non-reactive, durable
- **Copper** – traditional Ayurvedic, antimicrobial (can oxidize)

### Technique

## 5. Mouthwash

### Functional Uses

- **Antiseptic**: Chlorhexidine (short-term use)

### When to Use

- After brushing at night (fluoride)

### What to Avoid with Mouthwash

- Avoid rinsing with water immediately after fluoride mouthwash; wait at least 30 minutes for full benefit.
