# Comprehensive Guide to Dental Health: Diet and Practices

## Vegetables for Dental Health

* Fiber helps clean teeth and promotes saliva production.
* Some crunchy vegetables provide a natural scrubbing action.

**Specific Vegetables Discussed:**

* **Carrots:** Crunchy, help clean teeth, source of vitamins.
* **Lettuce (especially darker green varieties like Spinach, Kale):** High in vitamins and minerals, fiber.
* **Spinach & Kale:** Particularly nutrient-dense leafy greens.
* **Broccoli & Cauliflower (Cruciferous Vegetables):** Packed with vitamins and minerals.
* **Celery:** Crunchy, high in fiber, helps clean teeth, low in calories.
* **Bell Peppers (Red, Yellow, Green):** High in Vitamin C, crunchy. Generally safe, though high fiber can cause mild digestive issues for some if eaten in excess.
* **Beans:** Excellent source of fiber, protein, calcium, and phosphorus (important for strong teeth).

## Dairy Products and Alternatives

**General Benefits:**

* Key source of **Calcium** and **Phosphorus** for building and maintaining strong tooth enamel.
* Some dairy products contain **Probiotics**.

**Specific Items Discussed:**

* **Cow's Milk:** Good source of calcium and Vitamin D.
* **Soy Milk:** Good alternative, especially if lactose intolerant (though you mentioned you are not). Provides protein; ensure it's fortified with calcium if using as a primary calcium source.
* **Yogurt:** Excellent source of calcium and often contains probiotics (beneficial for oral and gut health).
* **Cheese (e.g., Cheddar):** High in calcium, can help neutralize mouth acids, stimulates saliva.
  * **Considerations:** Contains fat and sodium, so moderation is key. Lower-fat options like mozzarella or feta can be considered.

## Other Important Food Categories & Items

* **Grains:**
  * You mentioned eating white and sticky rice. Suggestion was to incorporate more **whole grains** (like brown rice) for better nutritional value and fiber.
* **Proteins:**
  * **Fish (e.g., Pla Seek):** Good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.
* **Processed Foods:**
  * **Sausages:** High in sodium and unhealthy fats; should be limited.

## Drinks and Oral Health

  * **Essential for hydration** and saliva production.
  * Helps **rinse away food particles and acids**.
